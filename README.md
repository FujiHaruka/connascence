## How You can Help

### Help fix bugs

Found a typo, gramatical error, or just odd sentence structure? Please let us know! Either [File an issue report](https://github.com/connascence/websource/issues) or fix it yourself and create a pull request.

### Contribute art or design

We'd love some help with the look and feel of the website. Currently it's a vanilla twitter bootstrap theme. If you can help out in this regard, [File an issue report](https://github.com/connascence/websource/issues) with your ideas, and we can help you make it a reality.

### Contribute more / better examples

Many of the examples in the website can be improved, and we're always revising the list of connascences. Contributions to both are more than welcome.

:summary: Connascence of type is when multiple components must agree on the type of an entity.


Connascence of type is when multiple components must agree on the type of an entity. In statically typed languages, the type of method arguments is an example of this form of connascence. If a method changes the type of its argument from an integer to a string, callers of that method must be changed to pass a different argument than before.

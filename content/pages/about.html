				<p>Connascence is a software quality metric that attempts to measure coupling between entities. The term was used in a computer science context by Meilir Page-Jones in his article, <a href="http://wiki.cfcl.com/pub/Projects/Connascence/Resources/p147-page-jones.pdf">Comparing techniques by means of encapsulation and connascence</a>, <em>Communications of the ACM</em> volume 35 issue 9 (September 1992).</p>
				<p>In 1996, Meilir Page-Jones included a large section on connascence in his book "What every programmer should know about object-oriented design". The book can still be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Every-Programmer-Should-Object-Oriented-Design/dp/0932633315" target="_blank">found on amazon.com</a>.

				<p>Since Meilir Page-Jones published his book, several other people have adapted and expanded on the concept of connascnence.</p>
				<h4>Jim Weirich</h4>
				<p>The greatest proponent of connascence is probably the late Jim Weirich. Several examples of his contributions to the industry can be found below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQXVKHoUQxY">Connascence Examined</a>. A one hour long talk from 2012 that goes into considerable detail of the various types of connascence.</li>
					<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/10837903">Grand Unified Theory of Software Design</a>. A 45 minute talk given at 'Aloha on Rails'.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLT7Qcn_PmI">The Grand Unified Theory</a>. An earlier talk from 2009. Note: The audio quality on this talk is questionable at times.</li>
					<li><a href="https://yow.eventer.com/yow-2012-1012/connascence-examined-by-jim-weirich-1273">Connascence Examined</a>. Jim Weirich gave an hour long talk at YOW in 2012.</li>
					<li><a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-60-solid-with-jim-weirich">Ruby Rogues ep. 60</a>. Ruby Rogues is a weekly podcast about programming. This episode features Jim Weirich, and discusses both the SOLID principles and connascence.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Kevin Rutherford</h4>
				<p>Kevin Rutherford has published a <a href="http://silkandspinach.net/tag/connascence/">series of blog posts about connascence</a>: they have inspired much of the content on this website.</p>
				<h4>Multiple Authors</h4>
				<p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd0v72pD1MI">this google hangout</a> was broadcast that included several luminaries of the software development industry, including Corey Haines, Curtis Cooley, Dale Emery, J. B. Rainsberger, Jim Weirich, Kent Beck, Nat Pryce, and Ron Jeffries.</p>
				<h4>Josh Robb</h4>
				<p>In 2015 Josh Robb gave a talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip2o4vbAK3s">Connascence &amp; Coupling</a> at codemania. That talk was the inspiration to build this site.</p>

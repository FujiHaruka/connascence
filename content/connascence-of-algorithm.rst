:summary: Connascence of algorithm is when multiple components must agree on a particular algorithm.


Connascence of algorithm is when multiple components must agree on a particular algorithm. Message authentication codes are an example of this form of connascence. Both sides of the exchange must implement exactly the same hashing algorithm or the authentication will fail.
